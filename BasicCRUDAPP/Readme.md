This app will use Node, npm, MongoDB Compass, and Postman
Use libraries:
- express: small framework for Node that provides many useful features, such as routing and middleware
- cors: Express middleware to parse the body of incoming requests
- mongoose: a MongoDB ODM (the NoSQL equivalent of an ORM) for Node. It provides a simple validation and query API to help you interact with your MongoDB database
- Nodemon: a simple monitor script which will automatically restart a Node app when file changes are detected
